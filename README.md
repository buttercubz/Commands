# obsolescence information, this tool will no longer continue to be actively developed, it will only live updates that break its operation in later versions of deno. please use other alternatives such as [trex](https://github.com/crewdevio/Trex#run-scripts-experimental), [velociraptor](https://deno.land/x/velociraptor) or [denon](https://deno.land/x/denon)

for deno users now you can create command shortcuts to run files in deno and listen to changes in files.

create a file called run.json

inside he writes:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "yourCommand": "--[any] anyFile.ts or .js"
  },
  "files": ["./myWatch.ts", "./src/index.js"]
}
```

> **note:** by default listen to all files

to install `Commands` for deno you must run the command:

```sh
$ deno install --allow-read --allow-run -n commands --unstable https://deno.land/x/commands/Commands.ts
```

to update `Commands` run:

```sh
$ deno install -f --allow-read --allow-run -n commands --unstable https://deno.land/x/commands/Commands.ts
```

## Use with deno

example:

in run.json

```json
{
  "config": {
    "start": "--allow-net server.ts"
  },
  "files": ["./app.ts", "./server.ts"]
}
```

in command line

```sh
$ commands start
```

## info âš 

the run.json file must be at the root of the directory to function.

Commands for deno is created with the standard libraries which are not yet completely stable, any problem can create an issue to the repository
